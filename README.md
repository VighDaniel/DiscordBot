## DiscordBot
Well discord is an application where you can join servers and send messages to peaple or to text channels and you can also join voice chats. Discord is kinda like Slack, but for gaming purposes. Discord has it's own node.js package for handling events and making the bot.

## How does it work?

A discord command looks something like this:
<code>${command} {parameter1} {parameter2}</code>
I basically made a Router that processes and executes the command.
The default command variable is "$", so a command looks like the following:
<code>$meme {subreddit_slug}</code>
